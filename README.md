# PIC-Audio-Player
Just a small project that plays small audio files from a PIC micro as a single chip solution, very limited within the functionality though it works. It's based on the use of PCM data, that is then put into an array where each location in the array represents an induvidual sample of the recording. The PIC micro then plays the recording by quickly reading the samples at a very high speed of about 8000Hz. This all happens at the push of a button. The frequency at which the PWM runs at is about 12.5kHz, so a low pass filter is required to effectively distinguish what is being played back. With the PIC Microcontroller I'm using, the PIC16F1825, I can get about 3/4 of a second of audio and still have a decent amount of program (flash in this case) memory left over for the code that plays the message back.
